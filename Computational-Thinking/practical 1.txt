In the Box Hunt task, I understood that it is useful to first decompose the problem into several parts, such as: what to do when opening boxes for the first time, what to do during the recording and organizing stage, what to do during subsequent retrieval, and how to handle special cases (for example, when there is no notepad, or in similar situations such as searching for items in a supermarket or books in a bookstore).
I also learned algorithmic thinking: abstracting concrete tasks into core elements. For example, abstracting the problem of finding items into creating a "dictionary/table" (through sorting or mapping) to locate elements. This allows for more efficient retrieval later.
When there is no notepad, considering how to rely solely on "human memory" and "spatial arrangement" made me realize the necessity of managing information in limited space, similar to computer storage systems.
