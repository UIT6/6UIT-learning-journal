# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This workspace is a learning journal for Programming I, containing lecture notes, practical exercises, and Python code samples. The focus is on foundational programming concepts, with an emphasis on clear, step-by-step solutions and code readability for beginners.

## Structure & Key Files
- Lecture notes: `lecture 1.md`, `lecture 2Â·~5.md`, ..., `lecture 11.md` (Markdown, bilingual notes)
- Practical exercises: `practical1~6.md` (contains both questions and Python code answers)
- Example code: `lecture 11_run.py` (multiple Fibonacci implementations, recursion, memoization)

## Coding Patterns & Conventions
- All code is written in standard Python 3, with no external dependencies except for standard library modules (e.g., `functools.lru_cache`).
- Code samples are often repeated in both Markdown and `.py` files for clarity and reference.
- Input/output is handled via `input()` and `print()` for interactive console use.
- Solutions are provided in multiple styles (for loop, while loop, recursion, memoization) to illustrate different approaches to the same problem.
- Error handling is basic, using simple `if`/`elif`/`else` blocks.
- Variable names are short and descriptive (e.g., `a`, `b`, `n`, `terms`).
- Markdown files may contain both English and Chinese explanations for educational clarity.

## Developer Workflow
- No build system or test framework is present; code is run directly via the Python interpreter.
- To run code, use: `python <filename>.py` in the terminal.
- Practical exercises are organized by sheet and problem number, with code blocks for each answer.
- New code samples should follow the style and structure of existing lecture and practical files.

## Examples
- See `lecture 11_run.py` for multiple Fibonacci implementations (for/while/recursion/memoization).
- See `practical1~6.md` for practical exercise format and answer style.

## Special Notes
- Maintain bilingual (English/Chinese) explanations where present.
- Keep code beginner-friendly and well-commented.
- Do not introduce external dependencies or advanced patterns unless explicitly required.

For any new code or documentation, follow the patterns and clarity demonstrated in the existing files. If unsure, reference the most recent lecture or practical file for style guidance.
